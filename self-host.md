npm install
```
- After cloning Fill all requirement in `.env` **(rename `.env.example` to `.env`)**

## Setting up Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for mochi to work correctly.

You can set the environment variables in any way you like or place a .env file at the root of your project (rename `.env.example` to `.env`),
Ensure that your `.env` looks like this:

## Start your bot
Set up the environment variables as described above.

- Install pm2 globally by running 
```js
npm i -g pm2
```
- Start the bot
```bash
npm start
```

>You can also run `npm run start` to start the bot.

- NOTE: running `npm start` or `npm run start` will start the bot with PM2 and give it the name "mochi." You can replace "mochi" with a name of your choice in [package.json](./package.json). It will also show logs for the bot and save the pm2 processes.

<details>
<summary> [EXPAND] COMMON ERRORS </summary>
  
```js

```
>It means that the bot is already running. You can delete it by running the following command followed by the command to start the bot, i.e., `npm run start`:
```
pm2 delete mochi
```
> Or restart it by running:
```
pm2 restart mochi
```

</details>

- If you are in a dev environment, use `node .` or `npm run dev` to test your code:
```
node .
```
Once you are satisfied with the changes, run the following:
```
pm2 restart mochi && pm2 logs
```
You can also restart it from the [pm2.io dashboard](https://pm2.io/) as shown bellow:

## Dashboard Setup

- In the config.js, make sure you set dashboard enabled to **true**
- Add your base URL and `http://localhost:8080/api/callback` in your application OAuth2 redirects page in the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

```js
  DASHBOARD: {
    enabled: true, // enable or disable dashboard
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8080", // base url
    failureURL: "http://localhost:8080", // failure redirect URL
    port: "8080", // port to run the bot on
  },
```
- To run your dashboard on your domain, follow this guide [ðŸ”Œ | Connect Dashboard - DJS Bot - Ubuntu - Apache](https://blog.riverdev.wtf/connect-dashboard-djs-bot-ubuntu-apache) by [River](https://github.com/River198) or view this [discussion](https://github.com/Androz2091/AtlantaBot/discussions/371),

#### Auto-restarting your bot on git pull
- Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/vixshan/mochi.git
```
- Create a new file in the hooks directory of your Git repository:
```
nano .git/hooks/post-merge
```
- Add the following code to the post-merge file:
```
#!/bin/sh
# pull the latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin master
# restart the bot using PM2
pm2 restart mochi
```
Save and close the file.

- Make the file executable:
```
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
```
Every time you run `git pull`, it will automatically run the post-merge hook and pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository. The bot will also be restarted automatically using PM2.

>NOTE:<br>
If you want to use `git pull` to update your code automatically, you must keep your GitHub repository public. If you're going to keep your code private, consider using a different method, such as deploying from your machine or using a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool such as Jenkins, TravisCI, CircleCI, etc. These tools allow you to securely deploy code from a private repository without exposing it publicly.

### Setting up Slash Commands

- Slash commands are disabled by default
- In the [**config.js**](./config.js), set **`SLASH = true`** and **`CONTEXT = true`** and replace `TEST_GUILD_ID` with the guild ID where you want to test the commands initially. This will ensure that all the commands are registered immediately
- Once you are happy with the commands, set **`GLOBAL = true`** to register these interactions globally

>**Global slash commands** can take up to 1 hour to be shown across all guilds. You can use the `m!reload` command to sync the commands across all guilds. This will also update the commands if you have made any changes.
