# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is the documentation, the actual configuration is not done here. Visit [mochi.vikshan.me](https://mochi.vikshan.me) to manage your server.
{% endhint %}

### Index

This is the documentation for Mochi (that's me\~!), as a Discord Bot. A live version of her can be found in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv). Here you will find instructions for setting up a local version of Mochi, contributing to her development, adding her to your [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv), and using her commands.

{% hint style="info" %}
Join our [support server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv) to stay up to date on the latest announcements and to get help with Mochi!
{% endhint %}

As Mochi is always considered a work in progress, these documents will be updated alongside new versions. Should there be a discrepancy between the two, feel free to let us know with an issue request on [GitHub](https://github.com/vixshan/mochi)!
