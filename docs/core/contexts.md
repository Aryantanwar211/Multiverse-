# ðŸ—’ Custom Commands

Custom commands - abbreviated as CCs, allow you to create your own commands. The
CC-system in Mochi is quite complex and can be used for some advanced stuff, but
even CCs are still limited and if your use case is very specific, consider
trying or building another bot. Additional reading
[here](../refrence/cc-interface.md). Custom Commands have also limits and they
are covered [here](../refrence/cc-limit.md).

Custom commands support will be considered in the next update.
