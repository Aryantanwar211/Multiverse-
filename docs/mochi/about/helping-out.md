[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton\_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/C0C1PUABU)

There are several ways you can help in making Mochi better!

* Supporting Mochi through [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/vikshan)
* Supporting us through [Patreon](https://patreon.com/vikshan)
* Writing documentation. The bot needs documentation - More details below
* Help out other people on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv)
* Writing code.

## Writing the documentation

Mochi is one of the more complicated bots out there. Therefore, a lot of documentation is needed for people to fully utilize and understand the features the bot provides.

If you're interested in adding things to the documentation, contact us on our [support server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv) or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vixshan/mochi).

## Writing code for the bot

You can also write code for the bot - it's open source. The bot is written in discord.js and you can view its code on [GitHub](https://github.com/vixshan/mochi). Please only add features if you really know how to write code in JavaScript. If you don't know how to change files on GitHub, watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ).

## Helping out on the support server

If you are knowledgeable about the bot and you want to help others then join the [support server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv) and start helping out. If you are active and helpful on the server, we may ask you to come on board as a support staff.
