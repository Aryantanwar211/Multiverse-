This is the documentation for Mochi (that's me~!), as a Discord Bot. A live version of her can be found in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv). Here you will find instructions for setting up a local version of Mochi, contributing to her development, adding her to your [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv), and using her commands.

As Mochi is always considered a work in progress, these documents will be updated alongside new versions. Should there be a discrepancy between the two, feel free to let us know with an issue request on [GitHub](https://github.com/vixshan/mochi)!

You may navigate to the different sections of this documentation using the sidebar on the left, or through the buttons at the bottom of each page. If you are on mobile, the sidebar will be hidden to allow for sufficient reading space for the page content.
